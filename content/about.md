I'm a Product Engineer based in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

I'm currently working on [Chartr](https://chartr.ai), an AI-powered platform for visual storytelling.

Prior to this, I led Product Engineering at [SciSports](/projects/scisports), where I designed and built data-driven interfaces to help football clubs make better decisions.

In the years preceding, I built a [variety of products and experiences](/projects), working with startups as well as larger companies.

In what seems like eons ago, I started my career as a consultant with [McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/) after studying engineering at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/).

## Interests

When I'm not working on professional projects, I enjoy travelling, hiking and diving (while documenting these on [Youtube](https://youtube.com/user/etothepipplus1/videos) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/vigneshenoy)). 

Playing competitive sports has been a big part of my life since a young age - cricket, football and ultimate frisbee are my all-time faves.
