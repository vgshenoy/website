[Indiahikes](https://indiahikes.com) is India's largest trekking community - they run over 20 treks in various ranges of the Himalayas, drive conservation efforts and undertake outdoor education programmes.

I first came on board in 2017, when I redesigned the online flow of a user browsing treks and picking one to book themselves on. To design the new flow, we laid out all factors that trekkers might consider while making a choice including time of the year, region, snow cover, flora and fauna. We then segmented and profiled visitors according to their trekking experience. For instance, a large number of trekkers are first-timers while experienced trekkers are interested only in moderate to difficult treks. Keeping the size and needs of these segments in mind, the final design had to be a balance between recommendation, exploration and availability.

In this project, I took a bit of an experimental approach of rapid prototyping in [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org). Leveraging [Bulma](https://bulma.io) and open source Vue components allowed iteration at speed which I deployed using Zeit's [Now](https://zeit.co/now) to [ih-treks.now.sh](https://ih-treks.now.sh). This allowed the team at Indiahikes to see and play around with responsive, interactive versions of my design, rather than static and separate mobile, tablet and desktop versions.
