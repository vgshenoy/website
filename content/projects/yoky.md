[Yoky Tag](https://yoky.io/tag) is a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) powered device that helps you keep track of the belongings you tag them onto. It works in tandem with a companion app available on both Android and iOS smartphones. It was launched in 2016 and was featured in [Mint](https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/oO9albNSGCcT3RZxBCxgSO/Yoky-Tag-review-For-finding-misplaced-keys-and-more.html), [Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/article/technology/yoky-because-it-s-human-to-forget-116073100790_1.html), [Deccan Chronicle](https://www.deccanchronicle.com/technology/gadgets/290716/in-a-new-yoky-state-of-find.html), [Mid-Day](https://www.mid-day.com/articles/tech-new-wireless-tracker-will-ensure-youll-never-lose-your-belongings/17529176) among other media outlets.

While working at [Gida](https://gida.in) (a product and service development company), we saw BLE maturing as a technology and decided to work on this idea. Taking it from concept to prototype and finally into production nearly two years and several design iterations.

I was responsible for two major pieces of making this happen. First, the design and supply chain for all non-electronic components. For this, I scouted, shortlisted and worked with a number of vendors (plastics, rubber, waterproofing, packaging, 3D printing) in India and China. The second piece was the end to end purchase and shipping experience. This included development of the website where customers could learn about the product and personalise it (we offered customer-uploaded images and colors) all the way to our backend system used to assemble the ordered units and ship it with providers like FedEx.
