    desc: `<p><a href="https://nostragamus.in" target="_blank">Nostragamus</a> is a daily fantasy sports app with a twist - instead of picking a full team within constraints of a budget, users have to answer a series of questions about player or team performances. Each question comes with context and statistics, which put together, serve as a compact preview of upcoming matches. Since launch, Nostragamus has grown to over a million registered users at over tens of thousands of daily active users in traffic.</p>
      <p>I created this concept for <a href="https://sportscafe.in/" target="_blank">Sportscafe</a> in 2016, when they were exploring an interactive angle to their sports coverage. Offerings in the fantasy sports space tend to be geared towards 'Pro' users, who have the time and motivation to stay on top of sports news and carefully build a team keeping in-game budget constraints in mind. I wanted to create something that could bring more casual sports followers into the fold.</p>
      <p>I wireframed early prototypes on paper and <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/" target="_blank">Sketch</a>, and then lead product development into launch in early 2017, working closely with the design, engineering and content teams at Sportscafe. A critical piece in the system that I architected is an admin portal + database that allows the content team to create questions and push out content on a daily basis to the app. To build this out I leaned on <a href="https://vuejs.org" target="_blank">Vue.js</a> + <a href="https://nodejs.org" target="_blank">Node.js</a> + <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a>.</p>

      <p>I first came on board in 2017, when I redesigned the online flow of a user browsing treks and picking one to book themselves on. To design the new flow, we laid out all factors that trekkers might consider while making a choice including time of the year, region, snow cover, flora and fauna. We then segmented and profiled visitors according to their trekking experience. For instance, a large number of trekkers are first-timers while experienced trekkers are interested only in moderate to difficult treks. Keeping the size and needs of these segments in mind, the final design had to be a balance between recommendation, exploration and availability.</p>
      <p>In this project, I took a bit of an experimental approach of rapid prototyping in <a href="https://vuejs.org" target="_blank">Vue.js</a>. Leveraging <a href="https://bulma.io" target="_blank">Bulma</a> and open source Vue components allowed iteration at speed which I deployed using Zeitâ€™s <a href="https://zeit.co/now" target="_blank">Now</a> to <a href="https://ih-treks.now.sh" target="_blank">ih-treks.now.sh</a>.

      <p>I was responsible for two major pieces of making this happen. First, the design and supply chain for all non-electronic components.  For this, I scouted, shortlisted and worked with a number of vendors (plastics, rubber, waterproofing, packaging, 3D printing) in India and China.  The second piece was the end to end purchase and shipping experience. This included development of the website where customers could learn about the product and personalise it (we offered customer-uploaded images and colors) all the way to our backend system used to assemble the ordered units and ship it with providers like FedEx.</p>
